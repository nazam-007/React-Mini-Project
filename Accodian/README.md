# Accordion Project

This project is an Accordion component built with React. It includes features to enable or disable multiple accordions being opened simultaneously.

## Features

1. **Enable/Disable Multi-Selection**:
    - **Enable Button**: When you click the "Enable Multi Selection" button, multiple accordion sections can be opened simultaneously.
    - **Disable Button**: When you click the "Disable Multi Selection" button, only one accordion section can be opened at a time. Opening a new section will close any currently open section.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
